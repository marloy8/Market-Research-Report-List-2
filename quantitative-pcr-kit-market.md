<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quantitative PCR Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Probe-Based</li><li>SYBR Green</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Quantitative PCR Kit market consists of two main types: Probe-Based and SYBR Green. In Probe-Based PCR, a specific probe is used to bind and amplify the target DNA sequence, providing high specificity and sensitivity. SYBR Green PCR, on the other hand, uses a fluorescent dye that binds to all double-stranded DNA, allowing the real-time detection of PCR amplification. Both methods are widely used in molecular biology research and diagnostics, offering different advantages and applications depending on the specific needs of the experiment or analysis.</p></p>
