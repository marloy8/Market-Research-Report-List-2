<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nasal Cannulas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Flow Nasal Cannulas</li><li>Low Flow Nasal Cannulas</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nasal cannulas are medical devices used for oxygen therapy. The market is divided into two types: high flow and low flow nasal cannulas. High flow nasal cannulas deliver a higher volume of oxygen and are designed for patients with severe respiratory conditions. They provide a more comfortable and effective oxygen supply by delivering a constant flow of air/oxygen mixture. On the other hand, low flow nasal cannulas are used for patients with less severe respiratory conditions, delivering a lower volume of oxygen and relying more on the patient's breath for oxygen intake.</p></p>
