<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Embolic Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>6% EVOH</li><li>8% EVOH</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquid embolic agent market consists of two major types: 6% ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) and 8% EVOH. These agents are used in the medical field to treat vascular malformations, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and aneurysms. The 6% EVOH agent has a lower concentration of EVOH compared to the 8% EVOH agent. Both types of liquid embolic agents are effective in blocking blood flow to abnormal blood vessels, helping to reduce the risk of bleeding or rupture.</p></p>
