<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED and OLED Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive-matrix</li><li>Active-matrix</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LED (Light Emitting Diode) display and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display are types of display technologies used in electronic devices. In terms of market types, LED displays can be categorized into two types: passive-matrix and active-matrix. Passive-matrix is more affordable and simpler, but it suffers from slower response times and limited color representation. Active-matrix is more advanced and commonly used in modern devices, providing faster response times, higher resolution, and better color reproduction. OLED displays, on the other hand, utilize organic compounds to emit light and do not require a backlight, resulting in thinner and more flexible screens.</p></p>
