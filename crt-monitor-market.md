<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CRT Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Random-Scan displays</li><li>Raster-scan displays</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>CRT monitors, also known as cathode ray tube monitors, can be categorized into two market types: random-scan displays and raster-scan displays. Random-scan displays utilize a technique where the electron beam directly targets specific positions on the screen to create images. This type of monitor is commonly used in computer-aided design systems. On the other hand, raster-scan displays work by scanning the electron beam in a pattern across the entire screen, creating images line by line. This type of monitor is commonly used in television sets and computer monitors.</p></p>
