<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Navigation Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incandescent Lamp</li><li>LED Lamp</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ship navigation lights market consists of two main types of lighting technology: incandescent lamps and LED lamps. Incandescent lamps are traditional light sources that produce light through the heating of a filament inside a glass bulb. These lamps are widely used but have drawbacks such as higher energy consumption and shorter lifespan. On the other hand, LED lamps are more energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan. They utilize light-emitting diodes to generate light, providing brighter illumination while consuming less power. The market for LED lamps is growing rapidly, as they offer better performance and cost-effectiveness compared to incandescent lamps.</p></p>
