<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Bonding Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etch</li><li>Total-etch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental bonding agents are used in restorative dentistry to enhance the adhesion between the tooth structure and restorative materials. Two types of bonding agents are commonly used: Self-etch and Total-etch. Self-etch bonding agents contain acids that simultaneously etch the tooth structure and prime it for bonding, simplifying the bonding process. On the other hand, Total-etch bonding agents involve separate etching and priming steps, where the acid etches the tooth structure and a separate primer is applied for better adhesion. Each type has its advantages and is used depending on the specific dental procedure and practitioner's preference.</p></p>
