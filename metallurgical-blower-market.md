<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallurgical Blower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Blower</li><li>Positive Displacement Blower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metallurgical blower market consists of two main types: centrifugal blowers and positive displacement blowers. Centrifugal blowers use centrifugal force to increase air or gas pressure, creating high airflow and moderate pressure. They are ideal for industrial applications that require continuous and steady airflow. On the other hand, positive displacement blowers use mechanical means to trap and move a fixed volume of air or gas. They are commonly used in applications that necessitate high-pressure or vacuum conditions, such as metal processing and foundries.</p></p>
