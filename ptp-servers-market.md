<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTP Servers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Clock</li><li>Boundary Clock</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTP (Precision Time Protocol) Servers, commonly used for synchronizing clocks on computer networks, can be categorized into two market types: Ordinary Clock and Boundary Clock. </p><p>Ordinary Clocks synchronize time with a single PTP server and distribute it to other devices on the network, ensuring accurate timekeeping. </p><p>Boundary Clocks, on the other hand, act as intermediaries between devices and multiple PTP servers, helping to distribute time more efficiently. They reduce network traffic by synchronizing with one server and provide time to devices connected to them. These market types cater to different network needs and ensure precise time synchronization.</p></p>
