<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lignite Mining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquification</li><li>Gasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lignite mining refers to the extraction of lignite, a type of low-grade coal, from underground deposits. The liquification market involves the conversion of lignite into liquid fuel through a process called liquification, which makes it suitable for use as oil. On the other hand, gasification market involves the transformation of lignite into a synthetic gas, or syngas, through the process of gasification. This gas can be used as a fuel or further processed to produce chemicals or electricity. Both liquification and gasification provide alternative ways to utilize lignite, expanding its potential applications and markets.</p></p>
