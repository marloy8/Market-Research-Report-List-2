<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarm Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Addressable Systems</li><li>Conventional</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fire alarm systems are crucial for ensuring safety in buildings. There are two main types: Addressable Systems and Conventional systems. Addressable systems use individual addresses for each device connected to the system, allowing the location of a fire or fault to be precisely pinpointed. This makes it easier to identify and respond to specific incidents. On the other hand, Conventional systems divide the building into zones, indicating the general area of a fire or fault but not its exact location. While less precise, Conventional systems are typically less expensive and simpler to install.</p></p>
