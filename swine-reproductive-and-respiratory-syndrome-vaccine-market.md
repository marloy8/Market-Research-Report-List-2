<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Vaccine</li><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The swine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) vaccine market includes two main types of vaccines: active vaccines and inactivated vaccines. Active vaccines contain live but weakened strains of the PRRS virus, stimulating an immune response in pigs without causing the disease. Inactivated vaccines, on the other hand, are made by rendering the virus inactive through methods like heat or chemical treatment. Both types of vaccines aim to prevent PRRS outbreaks in swine populations, but they differ in the way they stimulate the pig's immune system.</p></p>
