<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Starch Blended Biodegradable Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biodegradable Starch</li><li>Durable Starch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Starch blended biodegradable polymer refers to a type of polymer that combines starch, a natural and renewable resource, with other materials to create a biodegradable product. There are two main types of starch blended biodegradable polymers: biodegradable starch and durable starch. Biodegradable starch polymers are designed to break down over time, reducing environmental impact. Durable starch polymers, on the other hand, are more resistant to degradation and can be used for longer periods of time. Both types offer alternatives to traditional, non-biodegradable plastics and contribute to sustainable practices.</p></p>
