<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Inspection Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical Wafer Inspection</li><li>E-Beam Wafer Inspection</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wafer inspection device market includes two main types: optical wafer inspection and e-beam wafer inspection. Optical wafer inspection employs light-based techniques such as scatterometry and brightfield inspection to detect defects on wafers. It offers high throughput and low cost. On the other hand, e-beam wafer inspection uses a focused electron beam to scan and analyze wafers for defects. It provides higher resolution and sensitivity but is slower and more expensive compared to optical inspection. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring the quality and efficiency of wafer manufacturing processes.</p></p>
