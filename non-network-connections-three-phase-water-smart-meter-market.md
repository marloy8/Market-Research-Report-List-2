<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Network Connections Three Phase Water Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The non-network connections three-phase water smart meter market can be classified into two types: IC card and non-IC card. IC card smart meters utilize an integrated circuit card, which stores and transmits data wirelessly to a central system. This allows for convenient data collection and management. On the other hand, non-IC card smart meters require manual data reading and entry into a central system. Though less automated, these meters still enable efficient water consumption monitoring. Both types offer solutions for accurate measurement and monitoring of water usage in three-phase systems.</p></p>
