<p><strong>The Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aortic Stenosis</li><li>Aortic Regurgitation</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a medical procedure used to treat severe heart conditions such as Aortic Stenosis, Aortic Regurgitation, and other related ailments. Aortic Stenosis refers to the narrowing of the aortic valve, obstructing blood flow. Aortic Regurgitation occurs when the valve leaks, allowing blood to flow back into the heart. TAVR is an alternative to traditional open-heart surgery, where a prosthetic valve is inserted through a catheter, restoring normal blood flow and alleviating symptoms without the need for major surgery.</p></p>
