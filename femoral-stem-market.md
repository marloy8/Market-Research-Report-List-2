<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Stem Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented</li><li>Non-Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Femoral Stem market is classified into two main types: cemented and non-cemented. In the cemented femoral stem market, the implant is fixed in place using bone cement, while in the non-cemented market, the implant relies on the natural integration with the surrounding bone for stability. The cemented option provides immediate fixation and is often considered for older patients with weaker bones. In contrast, the non-cemented option allows for long-term stability, as it encourages natural bone growth around the implant.</p></p>
