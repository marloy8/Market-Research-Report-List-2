<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CPU Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooling</li><li>Water Cooling</li><li>Thermoelectric Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CPU fans market consists of three types: air cooling, water cooling, and thermoelectric cooling. Air cooling is the most common type, utilizing fans to dissipate heat from the CPU. Water cooling employs liquid coolant circulating through a radiator, offering better cooling performance but requiring more complex installation. Thermoelectric cooling employs the Peltier effect, where electrical current transfers heat away from the CPU. While thermoelectric cooling provides superior cooling, it is less mainstream due to its higher cost and power consumption compared to air and water cooling.</p></p>
