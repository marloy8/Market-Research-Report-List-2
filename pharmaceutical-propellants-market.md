<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Propellants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefied Gases</li><li>Compressed Gases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pharmaceutical propellants can be categorized into two types: liquefied gases and compressed gases. Liquefied gases are substances that exist in a liquid state at room temperature but can transform into gaseous form when released from their containers. They are commonly used in inhalers to deliver medication. On the other hand, compressed gases are stored under pressure and maintain their gaseous state. They are primarily employed in aerosol cans and act as a propellant that releases the pharmaceutical product when the valve is opened. Both types of propellants play crucial roles in pharmaceutical applications.</p></p>
