<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Remote Mounting</li><li>Direct Mounting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-pressure ball valves market offers two types of valve mountings: remote mounting and direct mounting. Remote mounting involves installing the valve away from the actuator, connected through a network of pipes. This setup is suitable for applications where the valve needs to be operated in a different location. On the other hand, direct mounting involves installing the valve directly onto the actuator, eliminating the need for additional piping. This type of mounting is preferred when space is limited or when a compact design is desirable.</p></p>
