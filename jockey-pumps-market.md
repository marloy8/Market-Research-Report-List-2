<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jockey Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Turbine Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Jockey pumps are used in fire protection systems to maintain pressure in the system. There are two types of jockey pumps: centrifugal pumps and turbine pumps. Centrifugal pumps use an impeller to generate pressure by increasing the velocity of the water. They are commonly used in small-scale fire protection systems. On the other hand, turbine pumps use the energy from a high-speed rotor to generate pressure. They are typically used in large-scale fire protection systems, such as high-rise buildings or industrial facilities. Both types of pumps serve the same purpose of maintaining pressure in the fire protection system.</p></p>
