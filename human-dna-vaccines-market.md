<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Human DNA Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Protein Vaccine</li><li>Gene-Based Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Human DNA vaccines are a type of vaccine that utilizes genetic material from pathogens to stimulate an immune response in the body. There are two main types of human DNA vaccines: recombinant protein vaccines and gene-based vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines use genetic engineering techniques to produce specific proteins from the pathogen, which are then used to stimulate an immune response. Gene-based vaccines directly deliver genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, into cells to produce viral proteins and trigger an immune response. Both types of vaccines offer potential benefits in terms of ease of manufacturing and improved efficacy.</p></p>
