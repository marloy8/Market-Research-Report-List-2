<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarm And Detection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Fire Detection and Alarm Systems</li><li>Addressable Fire Detection and Alarm Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire alarm and detection systems are essential for protecting buildings and occupants from potential fire hazards. There are two main types of systems: conventional fire detection and alarm systems and addressable fire detection and alarm systems. Conventional systems divide the building into zones, each with its own detection circuit, making it easier to identify the general location of a fire. In contrast, addressable systems can pinpoint the exact location of the fire, as each device has a unique address. This allows for quicker response and more precise control in case of an emergency.</p></p>
