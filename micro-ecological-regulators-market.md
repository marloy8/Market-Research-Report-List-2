<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro-ecological Regulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Probiotics</li><li>Prebiotics</li><li>Synbiotics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The micro-ecological regulators market includes three types: probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts, improving the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible fibers that serve as food for the beneficial bacteria, stimulating their growth and activity. Synbiotics combine both probiotics and prebiotics to enhance the survival and colonization of the beneficial bacteria in the gut, promoting overall gut health and digestion.</p></p>
