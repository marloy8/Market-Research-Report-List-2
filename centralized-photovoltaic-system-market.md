<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centralized Photovoltaic System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LCPV</li><li>HCPV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized Photovoltaic (PV) System is a type of solar power generation system that involves the concentration of sunlight onto a centralized area to generate electricity. There are two main types of Centralized PV systems – Low Concentration Photovoltaic (LCPV) system and High Concentration Photovoltaic (HCPV) system. LCPV uses low magnification lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells with lower efficiency. On the other hand, HCPV uses sophisticated tracking systems and high magnification lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells with higher efficiency. Both LCPV and HCPV systems are designed to deliver cost-effective and efficient solar power solutions.</p></p>
