<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acoustic Respiration Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wearable Acoustic Respiration Sensor</li><li>Non-wearable Acoustic Respiration Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acoustic respiration sensor market is categorized into two types: wearable and non-wearable sensors. Wearable acoustic respiration sensors are designed to be worn on the body, usually in the form of a patch or a band, and continuously monitor an individual's respiratory rate and breathing patterns. On the other hand, non-wearable acoustic respiration sensors are stationary devices that are placed in the environment, such as a bed or a chair, and detect respiratory movements through sound waves. Both types serve the purpose of tracking respiratory health but differ in terms of their physical design and usage.</p></p>
