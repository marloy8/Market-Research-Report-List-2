<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dacron Vascular Grafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Porosity</li><li>High Porosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dacron Vascular Grafts are medical devices used in vascular surgeries to replace or repair blood vessels. They come in two main types: Low Porosity and High Porosity. Low Porosity grafts have a dense structure that limits blood flow through the graft, making them suitable for small diameter vessels. On the other hand, High Porosity grafts have a more open structure that allows for increased blood flow, making them ideal for larger diameter vessels or situations where higher blood flow is required. Both types offer different benefits to surgeons based on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
