<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Photoresists</li><li>Positive Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor photoresists are materials used in the semiconductor industry to transfer patterns onto silicon wafers during the fabrication process. There are two main types of photoresists: negative photoresists and positive photoresists. Negative photoresists are light-sensitive materials that become less soluble when exposed to light. This means that the areas exposed to light become hardened, while the unexposed areas can be washed away. In contrast, positive photoresists become more soluble when exposed to light, allowing the unexposed areas to be washed away, leaving behind the desired pattern.</p></p>
